Recover lost sales immediately by sending the series of reminder emails to the customers.

== Description ==

According to the research, 60 to 70% is the average cart abandonment rate for online stores. Most of the users exit your site without buying even after visiting the checkout page. Despite the high number, it is possible to recover abandoned carts efficiently by sending the series of remainder emails.

You were only a few steps away from recovering your lost sales.
1. Install our Abandoned cart recovery plugin in your WooCommerce store.
2. Customize your email reminders that suit your theme and then activate the reminder.

Finally, sit and watch how our plugin gets back your lost revenue.

= How does this plugin work? =
Our plugin automatically captures visitor's email addresses when they went checkout page and enter their email in the billing email field.

If the customer didn't complete the purchase within 60  minutes(Cart cut off time), then our plugin considers those carts as an abandoned cart and starts sending automated reminder emails.

With the email series, you can remind your customers to complete their purchase, ask for feedback, or offer them a unique coupon code.

We recommend a series of 3 email reminders at predefined time intervals for better conversion. Below is an example of email sequences you can have:
1. The first email reminder will send to the customer after an hour of cart abandonment.
2. The second email will send after six hours after abandonment. If the first email does not satisfy customers to complete the purchase, then a second email could be triggered to induce urgency.
3. A third and final email could be triggered to persuade customers with an incentive to complete their purchase.

Also, personalize these recovery emails based on customer actions and optimize accordingly.
